Coptic artis theChristianart of theByzantine-Greco-Roman Egyptand ofCoptic Christian Churches. Coptic art is best known for its wall-paintings, textiles,illuminated manuscripts, and metalwork, much of which survives in monasteries and churches. The artwork is often functional, as little distinction was drawn between artistry and craftsmanship, and includes tunics and tombstones as well as portraits of saints.
TheCoptic MuseuminCoptic Cairo[1]houses some of the world's most important examples of Coptic art.[2]
Coptic art displays a mix of Egyptian andHellenistic influences.[3]Subjects and symbols were taken from bothGreekand Egyptian mythology, sometimes altered to fitChristian beliefs. Persia and Syria also influenced Coptic and Hellenistic art, though to a lesser extent, leaving images such as the peacock and the griffin.
Copticiconshave their origin in theGreco-Roman artof Egypt's Late Antiquity, as exemplified by theFayum mummy portraits.[4]The faces ofEl Fayumare examples of the Coptic art in the 2nd century AD showing theGreekandRoman influenceon the Coptic art but with some distinctive features related to Egyptian art.
The Muslim conquest of Egypt allowed the local Coptic art to influence Egypt's then Islamic art and architecture with many features that are now integral in many Egyptian buildings.
Beginning in the 4th century, churches painted their walls and made icons to reflect an authentic expression of their faith.
The figures of saints display eyes and ears larger in proportion to the rest of the face and a smaller mouth, as well as enlarged heads, signifying a spiritual relationship with God and devotion to prayer. Martyrs' faces were peaceful.
Many Coptic icon painters did not sign their names, but the prominent among them include St.Luke(traditionally believed to be the first icon painter) and twoCoptic Popes,Pope Macarius IandPope Gabriel III[5]
Starting mid-18th century icon painting enjoyed a revival in Egypt and once again was popular. One of the most famous artists wasYuhanna al-Armaniwhose works were noted for using more developed techniques and novel construction (e.g. using a set of icons to tell a single story).[6]
The influence of Coptic art and architecture onIslamic architectureand incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building started as early as the 7th century AD[7]
As theChurch of Alexandriawas the first Church of Africa the influence of Coptic art spread to Sudan and Ethiopia. Some forms of theCoptic crossare known as theEthiopian crossand many Churches in Ethiopia show the influence of the Coptic art.
Menas flasksare very cheapterracottabottles bought by pilgrims toAbu Mina, the shrine ofSaint Menas, in the 4th and 5th centuries. The clay was impressed before firing with blocks with images of the saint. They have been found nearly all over the Christian world, and many scholars trace influence from their fairly crude images in the emergingiconographyof Westernmedieval art, among other Coptic influences.
A remarkable number of Coptictextilessurvive today, due to the Coptic custom of burying them with the dead, and to the aridity of Egyptian graves. The textiles are commonly linen or wool and use the colors red, blue, yellow, green, purple, black and brown. The dyes were derived frommadder,indigo,woad,saffron, themurexshell, and thekermes insect. The first looms used were horizontal low-warp; vertical high-warp looms were introduced later. The basic garment was thetunic, which would become the dalmatic. Some tunics were woven in one piece. They were decorated by clavi, a stylistic import from Rome.
Some fine examples of the Coptic textile are shown in museums all over the world and a large collection is in theCoptic MuseuminCoptic Cairo[8]Tens of thousands of coloured fragments found their way into the museums of the world, especially after 1889 when the French archaeologistAlbert Gayetpublished a catalogue of Coptic art and, in theBulaq Museum, staged the first exhibition of Coptic monuments.[9]The early Coptic textiles still produced pictures and decoration incorporating Egyptian and Greek motifs. Shrouds, for example, might incorporate classical elements were painted in the form of an Egyptian sarcophagus and include representations of Egyptian gods to protect the dead. Later coptic textiles showed the influence of Byzantium and later, Islamic art.
Modern Coptic art is also known as the Neo-Coptic school. In recent centuries icons have been the main means of expression, keeping most traditional aspects. Coptic icons are more concerned religious truth and beauty than with realism, the depiction of depth, or perspective. As in theByzantineand related traditions, the figures are depicted frontally, looking straight at the viewer. Today, Coptic icons are found not only in churches, but also in homes and praying altars. They may also be purchased from Coptic gift shops throughoutEgyptand the Coptic diaspora.
During the papacy ofPope Cyril VI, the emergence of Coptic painters likeIsaac Fanous Youssef, along with the revival of Coptic art, brought about the creation of the Contemporary or Neo-Coptic school of iconography.
In 1952, architect and Coptic ChristianRamses Wissa Wasseffounded theRamses Wissa Wassef Art Centerin Giza, Egypt. He asked 14 children, mostly Copts, to develop a new artform by reviving the ancient coptic weaving method. The coptic weaverMaryam Hermina(born 1932) taught the children the technique. The Art Centre has a significant museum of the 20th century tapestries.
