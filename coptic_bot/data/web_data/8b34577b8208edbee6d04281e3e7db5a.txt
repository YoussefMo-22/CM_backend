TheCoptic Orthodox Church(Coptic:Ϯⲉⲕ̀ⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ⲛ̀ⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ ⲛ̀ⲟⲣⲑⲟⲇⲟⲝⲟⲥ,romanized:Ti-eklisia en-remenkimi en-orthodhoxos,lit.'the Egyptian Orthodox Church'), also known as theCoptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, is anOriental Orthodox Christianchurch based inEgypt. The head of the church and theSeeofAlexandriais thepope of Alexandriaon the Holy Apostolic See ofSaint Mark, who also carries the title of Father of fathers, Shepherd of shepherds, Ecumenical Judge and the 13th among the Apostles.
The See of Alexandria istitular. The Coptic pope presides fromSaint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedralin theAbbassiaDistrict inCairo. The church follows theCoptic Ritefor its liturgy, prayer and devotional patrimony. Adherents of the Coptic Orthodox Church make up Egypt's largest and most significant minority population, and the largest population of Christians in theMiddle East and North Africa (MENA).[1][2][3]They make up the largest share of the approximately 10 million Christians in Egypt.[8][9][10][11]
The Coptic Orthodox Church was established by Saint Mark, anapostleandevangelist, during the middle of the 1st century (c.AD 42).[12]Due to disputes concerning thenature of Christ, the Oriental Orthodox Churches were in schism after theCouncil of Chalcedonin AD 451.[13]
After AD 639, Egypt was ruled by itsIslamicconquerors fromArabia. In the 12th century, the church relocated its seat from Alexandria to Cairo. The same century also saw the Copts become a religious minority. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Nubian Christianity was supplanted by Islam. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the larger body of ethnic Egyptian Christians began to call themselves Coptic Orthodox, to distinguish themselves from the Catholic Copts and from the Eastern Orthodox, who are mostly Greek.[14]In 1959, theEthiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churchwas grantedautocephaly. This was extended to theEritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churchin 1998 following the successfulEritrean War of IndependencefromEthiopia. Since the2011 Egyptian revolution, Coptic Christians have suffered increased religious discrimination and violence.[15]
According to tradition, the Coptic Church was founded by St.Mark the Evangelistc.AD 42; it regards itself as the subject of manypropheciesin theOld Testament.[12]
TheCoptic languageis a universal language used in Coptic churches in every country. It descends fromAncient Egyptianand uses theCoptic alphabet, a script descended from theGreek alphabetwith added characters derived from theDemotic script. Today, the Bohairic dialect of Coptic is used primarily forliturgicalpurposes.[16]Many of the hymns in the liturgy are in Coptic and have been passed down for many centuries. The language is used to preserve Egypt's original language, which was banned by the Arab invaders, who ordered the use of Arabic instead.[17]However, most Copts speakArabic, the official language of Egypt.[16]Hence, Arabic is also used in church services nowadays. The service books, though written in Coptic, have Arabic text in parallel columns.[14]
TheCatechetical School of Alexandriais the oldestcatecheticalschool in the world.Jeromerecords that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Mark himself.[18]
The theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893.[19]
The school became a leading center of theallegorical method of biblical interpretation, espoused rapprochement between Greek culture and the Christian faith, and attempted to assert orthodox Christian teachings againstheterodoxviews in an era of doctrinal flux.[20]
In the 4th century, an AlexandrianpresbyternamedAriusbegan a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known asArianism. TheCouncil of Niceain AD 325 was convened byEmperor Constantine IafterPope Alexander I of Alexandriaproposed holding a council to respond to heresies.[21]A council under the presidency ofHosius of Cordovaattempted to resolve the dispute. This eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as theNicene Creed.[22]
In AD 381, PopeTimothy I of Alexandriapresided over the second ecumenical council known as theFirst Council of Constantinople, to judge Macedonius, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed theNicene Creedwith this confirmation of the divinity of theHoly Spirit:
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen[23]
Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings ofNestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was nothypostaticallyjoined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title "Mother of God" (Theotokos) to theVirgin Mary, declaring her instead to be "Mother of Christ"Christotokos.[citation needed]
The council confirmed the teachings ofAthanasiusand confirmed the title of Mary as "Mother of God".[24]It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Cyril had said that there is "One Nature for God the Word Incarnate" (Mia Physis tou Theou Logou Sesarkōmenē). The introduction to the creed is formulated as follows:[citation needed]
We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God(Theotokos)for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen.[24]
The church of Alexandria was part in communion with the rest of Christendom until theCouncil of Chalcedon.[16]When, in AD 451, EmperorMarcianattempted to heal divisions in the church, the response ofPope Dioscorus–the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled–was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the church. It was atChalcedonthat the emperor, through the imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness. In AD 449, Pope Dioscorus headed the 2nd Council of Ephesus, called the "Robber Council" by Chalcedonian historians. It held to theMiaphysiteformula which upheld the Christology of "One Incarnate Nature of God the Word" (Greek: μία φύσις Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη (mia physis Theou Logou sesarkōmenē)).[25][13]
In terms of Christology, theOriental Orthodox(Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is "One Nature—the Logos Incarnate,"ofthe full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians' understanding is that Christ isrecognized intwo natures, full humanity and full divinity.[14]Oriental Orthodoxy contends that such a formulation is no different from what theNestoriansteach.[13]
From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as theCoptic pope of Alexandria and patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark, and theMelkiteor Imperial patriarch, now known as theGreek Orthodox patriarch of Alexandria.[26][13]
Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church).[27][28][29]
By anathematizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at theSecond Council of Ephesusin AD 449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as a heretic by the council's canons.
Copts also believe that the pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.[30]
Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians "Monophysites", though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards Monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as "Dyophysite". A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is Miaphysite, which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos.[31][32]
TheMuslim invasion of Egypttook place in AD 639. Relying on eyewitness testimony, BishopJohn of Nikiuin his Chronicle provides a graphic account of the invasion from a Coptic perspective. Although the Chronicle has only been preserved in anEthiopic (Ge'ez)text, some scholars believe that it was originally written in Coptic.[33]John's account is critical of the invaders who he says "despoiled the Egyptians of their possessions and dealt cruelly with them",[34]and he details the atrocities committed by the Muslims against the native population during the conquest:
And when with great toil and exertion they had cast down the walls of the city, they forthwith made themselves masters of it, and put to the sword thousands of its inhabitants and of the soldiers, and they gained an enormous booty, and took the women and children captive and divided them amongst themselves, and they made that city a desolation.[35]
Though critical of the Muslim commander (Amr ibn al-As), who, during the campaign, he says "had no mercy on the Egyptians, and did not observe the covenant they had made with him, for he was of a barbaric race",[36]he does note that following the completion of the conquest, Amr "took none of the property of the Churches, and he committed no act of spoilation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days."[37]
Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, gradual conversions toIslamover the centuries had changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century.[38]Another scholar writes that a combination of "repression of Coptic revolts", Arab-Muslim immigration, and Coptic conversion to Islam resulted in the demographic decline of the Copts.[39]Egypt's Umayyad rulers taxed Christians at a higher rate than Muslims, driving merchants towards Islam and undermining the economic base of the Coptic Church.[40]Although the Coptic Church did not disappear, the Umayyad tax policies made it difficult for the church to retain the Egyptian elites.[41]
In 969, Egypt entered theFatimiddynasty (in Egypt from 969 to 1171), who adopted a largely favorable attitude toward the Christians. The major exception to this was the persecution led by Caliph al-Hakim between 1004 and 1013, which included clothing regulations, prohibition of publicly celebrating Christian festivals, and dismissal of Christian and Jewish functionaries. However, at the end of his reign al-Hakim rescinded these measures, allowing the Copts to regain privileged positions within the administration.[42]
The Coptic patriarchal residence moved from Alexandria to Cairo during the patriarchate ofCyril II (1078–92). This move was at the demand of the grand vizierBadr al-Jamali, who insisted that the pope establish himself in the capital.[42]WhenSaladin entered Egyptin 1163, this ushered in a government focused on defending Sunni Islam. Christians were again discriminated against, and meant to show modesty in their religious ceremonies and buildings.[42]
During the Ottoman period, Copts were classified alongside other Oriental Orthodox and Nestorian peoples under theArmenian millet.[43]
In 1798, the French invaded Egypt unsuccessfully and the British helped the Turks to regain power over Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty.[44]
The position of Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of theMuhammad Ali Dynasty. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 thejizyatax was abolished by Sa'id Pasha.[45]Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.[46]
Towards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853,Pope Cyril IVestablished the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was only the second national press in the country. The pope established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time, he left his church under the guidance of the Coptic patriarch.[46]
The Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893.[19]It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria and Cairo, and in various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt. It has campuses in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women study many subjects, including theology, church history, missionary studies, and the Coptic language.[46]
In 1959, theEthiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churchwas granted its first own PatriarchAbuna BasiliosbyPope Cyril VI.[47]Furthermore, theEritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churchsimilarly became independent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated byPope Shenouda III of Alexandriato form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gained itsautocephalyfrom the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by Pope Shenouda III.[48]
Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox and Eastern (Chalcedonian) Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing.[49]
In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox patriarchates of Alexandria agreed to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other.[50]
InTahrir Square, Cairo, on Wednesday 2 February 2011, Coptic Christians joined hands to provide a protective cordon around their Muslim neighbors duringsalat(prayers) in the midst of the2011 Egyptian Revolution.[51]
While Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history,Human Rights Watchhas noted growing religious intolerance and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, and a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible.[52][53]More than a hundred Egyptian copts were killed in sectarian clashes from 2011 to 2017, and many homes and businesses destroyed. InMinya, 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 were documented by theEgyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.[54]Coptic Christian women and girls are often abducted and disappear.[55][56]
In 2015, 21 men traveled to Libya to support their families.[57]There, they would bekidnapped and beheadedby the Islamic State in Libya.
UnderPope Shenouda III, from 1971 to 2012, the church underwent a large transformation. Writing in 2013, thetheologianSamuel Tadros stated "Today's Coptic Church as an institution is built solely on his vision".[58]For the first time in its history, the synod codified its internal laws. It also established numerous coptic institutions within and outside of Egypt. Shenouda raised the number of bishops from 26 to 117 and ordained hundreds of priests, which greatly reduced the influence of any one bishop. Shenouda also instituted a yearly meeting of the synod, which greatly expanded the number of laws governing the church. This included instituting church curriculums for the education of new priests, new deacons, and newly weds. For the first time in the Coptic Church's modern history, women could become ordained as deacons. The synod also adopted a model for community development, dramatically increasing the scope of community services provided by the church, including: hospitals, adult literacy schools, orphanages, libraries, and community centres. Much of this work was fuelled by donations from wealthy Coptic industrialists and Copts from abroad. Shenouda also held talks with the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, in an effort to promote ecumenism .[58]On 10 May 1973, Shenouda visited the Vatican, where a joint Christological declaration was issued jointly by the Coptic Orthodox and Catholic churches.[59]
Pope Shenouda also increased the Church's involvement in politics, seeing it as a way to advocate for the interest of Copts, during the rise of Islamism in Egypt and increase in terrorist attacks. The president of Egypt,Anwar Sadatordered that Shenouda be put into exile in a Coptic Monastery far away from Cairo in 1981. This exile was short lived, ending when Sadat was assassinated by Muslim extremists a few months later. Under president Hosni Mubarak, Shenouda continued his political stance and often protested persecution of Copts by leaving Cairo and staying in seclusion, which often caused the regime to quickly address issues. Shenouda's political involvement drew criticism from some church members, including the prominent monkFather Matta El Meskeen.[60][61]
On 17 March 2012, Pope Shenouda died, leaving many Copts mourning and worrying as tensions rose withMuslims. Shenouda constantly met with Muslim leaders in order to create peace, his death resulting in concerns that without his mediation good relations would break down. Many were worried about increased Islamic control of Egypt as theMuslim Brotherhoodwon 70% of the parliamentary elections.[62][63]Shenouda's approach to church leadership has, in part, been adopted by the current patriarch.Pope Tawadros II of Alexandriamaintains relations with the Egyptian government and other churches. However, while Shenouda was critical of the expanded influence of Protestant teaching and books in Coptic churches, Tawadros has increased ecumenical dialogue with several Protestant churches. Tawadros is a less political figure than his predecessor and has expressed support for the Egyptian government's institutions during crises.[64]
In 2020, a woman in Florida accused a former priest ofsexual assaultwhen she was a minor. She claimed that he was defrocked in 2014, but continued presenting himself as a priest. In response, the synod issued a public statement disavowing him and instituted anti-abuse measures. Several diocese in North America and Europe, issued statements in support of sexual assault survivors.[65][58][66]
On 10 May 2023, Pope Tawadros visited the Vatican to celebrate Coptic-Catholic Friendship day and the 50 year anniversary of the meeting between Pope Paul VI and Pope Shenouda III. In this same year Pope Francis announced that the 21 Coptic Martyrs killed by ISIS in Libya in 2015 would be added to the Catholic Roman Martyrology, and Pope Tawadros gifted relics from each of the21 martyrsto the Vatican.[67]
Communicants of the Coptic Orthodox Church use abreviaryknown as theAgpeyato pray thecanonical hoursat sevenfixed prayer timeswhile facing in theeastward direction, in anticipation of theSecond Coming of Jesus; this Christian practice has its roots in Psalm 119:164, in which the prophetDavidprays to God seven times a day.[69][68][70]Church bells enjoin Christians to pray at these hours.[71]Before praying, theywashtheir hands and face to be clean before and present their best to God;shoes are removedto acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God.[69][72]During each of the seven fixed prayer times, Coptic Orthodox Christians pray "prostrating three times in the name of theTrinity; at the end of each Psalm … while saying the 'Alleluia';" and 41 times for each of theKyrie eleisonspresent in a canonical hour.[72]In the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is customary for women to wear aChristian headcoveringwhen praying.[73]The Coptic Orthodox Church observes days ofritual purification.[74][75]However, while meat that still contains blood after cooking is discouraged from being eaten, the Coptic Church does not forbid its members from consuming any particular type of food, unlike in Islam orJudaism.[76]
All churches of the Coptic Orthodox Church are designed to face the eastward direction of prayer and efforts are made to remodel churches obtained from otherChristian denominationsthat are not built in this fashion.[77]
In Coptic Orthodox Christianity, fasting is defined as going without meat or dairy.[78]With respect toEucharistic discipline, Coptic Orthodox Christiansfastfrom midnight onwards (or at least nine hours) prior to receiving the sacrament ofHoly Communion.[79]They fast every Wednesday and Friday of the year (Wednesdays in remembrance of the betrayal of Christ, and on Fridays in remembrance of His crucifixion and death).[79]In total, fast days in a year for Coptic Orthodox Christians numbers between 210 and 240. This means that Copts abstain from all animal products for up to two-thirds of each year.[79][80]The fasts forAdventandLentare 43 days and 55 days, respectively.[79]In August, before the celebration of theDormition of the Mother of God, Coptic Christians fast 15 days; fasting is also done before the feast ofFeast of Saints Peter and Paul, starting from the day ofPentecost.[79][80]Married couples refrain from sexual relations during Lent "to give themselves time for fasting and prayer".[78]
Christmas has been a national holiday in Egypt since 2003. It is the only Christian holiday in Egypt.[81]Coptic Christmas, which usually falls on January 6 or 7 is a major feast. Other major feasts areEpiphany,Palm Sunday,Easter, Pentecost,Ascension, andAnnunciation. These are known in the Coptic world as the Seven Major Feasts. Major feasts are always preceded by fasts. Additionally, the Coptic Orthodox Church also has Seven Minor Feasts: the Circumcision of the Lord, Entrance into the Temple, Entrance into Egypt, Transfiguration,Maundy Thursday, Thomas Sunday, andGreat Lent.[16][81][82]Furthermore, there are several indigenous feasts of theTheotokos. There are also other feasts commemorating the martyrdom of important saints from Coptic history.[80]
Available Egyptian census figures and other third-party survey reports have not reported more than 4 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in Egypt.[1][2]However media and other agencies, sometimes taking into account the claims of the church itself, generally approximate the Coptic Orthodox population at 10% of the Egyptian population or 10 million people.[3][4][5]Egyptian Copts are the biggest Christian community in the Arab world. Estimates of their numbers vary, but generally range between 4.7 and 7.1 million.[83]The majority of them live in Egypt under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Since 2006, Egyptian censuses have not reported on religion and church leaders have alleged that Christians were under-counted in government surveys. In 2017, a government owned newspaperAl Ahramestimated the percentage of Copts at 10 to 15% and the membership claimed by the Coptic Orthodox Church is in the range of 20 to 25 million.[84][85][86][87]
There are also significant numbers in the diaspora outside Africa in countries such as theUnited States,Canada,Australia,France, andGermany. The exact number of Egyptian born Coptic Orthodox Christians in the diaspora is hard to determine and is roughly estimated to be close to 1 million.[88][89][90]
There are between 150,000 and 200,000 adherents inSudan.[91][92]
Besides Egypt, the Church of Alexandria has jurisdiction over all ofAfrica. The followingautocephalouschurches have strong historical ties to the Coptic Orthodox Church.
Tradition holds that Ethiopia was first evangelized bySt. MatthewandSt. Bartholomewin the 1st century ce, and the first Ethiopian convert is thought to have been the eunuch in Jerusalem mentioned inThe Acts of the Apostles(8:27–40). Ethiopia was further Christianized in the 4th century ce by two men (likely brothers) from Tyre—St. Frumentius.[93]Ever since the conversion ofEzana of Axumto Christianity byFrumentiusin 325 AD, theEthiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churchhas received its archbishops from the Coptic Orthodox Church.[94]Until the mid-twentieth century, the metropolitans of the Ethiopian church were ethnic Copts.Joseph IIconsecrated ArchbishopAbuna Basiliosas the first native head of theEthiopian Churchon 14 January 1951. In 1959,Pope Cyril VI of AlexandriacrownedAbuna Basiliosas the firstPatriarch of Ethiopia.[47]
Following the independence ofEritreafrom Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed toPope Shenouda III of Alexandriafor Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Pope Shenouda ordainedAbune Philliposas first Archbishop of Eritrea.[48]
The Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria is governed by itsHoly Synod, which is headed by thePatriarch of Alexandria. Under his authority are themetropolitan archbishops,metropolitan bishops,diocesan bishops,patriarchal exarchs,missionary bishops,auxiliary bishops,suffragan bishops, assistant bishops,chorbishopsand thepatriarchalvicarsfor the Church of Alexandria.[95]
