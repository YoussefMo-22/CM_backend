Papal Messageof the Glorious Feastof Resurrection2025
H.H. Pope Tawadros II
Praise be to God, we visited many countries. All these countries are blessings, and all of them are God’s creation, across the whole world. I travelled to England before monasticism, and during monasticism I travelled to multiple countries. As a bishop and pope, I visited many countries. Egypt has a special nature, and this nature comes from history. Egypt has a great history, so I encourage you to read about the ancient, middle and modern history of Egypt. Additionally, the Lord Christ visited the land of Egypt, which truly gave it a blessing.He moved in it from east to west, and from north to south, blessing it indeed. Egypt’s air has value, its soil has value, and the Egyptians have value among all the peoples of the world. We are a social nation. We like to be near each other and ask about each other. Since the days of the Pharaohs, we have felt near to each other, because of the Nile River. All nations are precious, but Egypt has advantages that are not found in other countries.On the map, Egypt is on the corner of the continent of Africa, and therefore it has many advantages. The area of ​​this continent is 30 million square kilometers. Egypt occupies one million of this, but a precious one million. The continent of Africa’s size is equivalent to the size of America, Europe and Russia together. Our country, with its location, history, civilization, and everything in it is more than wonderful! We need to look after it. Egypt’s godness is really great. Whoever lives in Egypt receives the blessing of the Holy Family, St. Mark, the saints, the monasteries, and the blessing of the great Egyptian history. Therefore, I see that Egypt is really in God’s heart. His eyes are on it, and His hand works in the midst of all the events.
From the heart of Egypt—the land that embraced the Holy Family in its journey and nourished the roots of Christian faith with the blood of martyrs—the features of Orthodox unity are renewed today beneath the domes of ancient churches and in the shadow of monastic palms in Wadi El-Natrun. There, where prayers have never ceased for centuries, the 15th meeting of the Heads of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in the Middle East is held, coinciding with the memorable anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea, which convened in 325 AD and laid the cornerstone of the universal Church’s faith.
Here, under the paternal care ofH.H. Pope Tawadros II, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark, theCoptic Orthodox Churchhosts this meeting with the participation ofH.H. Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II, Patriarch of Antioch and All the East for the Syriac Orthodox Church, andH.H. Catholicos Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia for the Armenian Orthodox Church. The fathers sit side by side to continue a single Orthodox life—founded in faith, revealed in love, and fruitful in hope.
The Oriental Orthodox Family and Its Ongoing Journey
The Oriental Orthodox family includes churches that have preserved the unaltered faith since the early centuries, adhering to sound doctrine and rejecting the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD). This rejection was not due to linguistic disputes or political conflicts but rooted in a doctrinal commitment born of a deep understanding of the Incarnation of Christ, as lived and taught by these churches and their saintly fathers.
The journey wasn’t easy. After the schism, these churches faced severe pressures from both religious and political powers. They endured centuries of isolation yet never abandoned their mission. They resisted heresies, stood firm against false teachings, and continued to witness through word and martyrdom, despite persecution and hardship.
A History of Endurance and Holiness
Figures who shaped the spiritual history of humanity emerged from this family:St. Jacob of Nisibis (338 AD)from Mesopotamia, a teacher and theologianSt. Anthony the Great (356 AD), who ignited the monastic movement from the Egyptian desertSt. Ephrem the Syrian (373 AD), who composed hymns and wrote profound theologySt. Athanasius the Apostolic (373 AD), who defended the legitimacy of faith against ArianismSt. Cyril of Alexandria (444 AD), who opposed Nestorius with the doctrine of the Word’s IncarnationSt. Gregory the Illuminator, who made Armenia the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion in 301 AD
Generations of fathers and scholars followed, and the Church’s life became etched in their stories—stories written with sweat and blood in defense of the faith.
Churches Breathing from the Heart of Civilizations
TheSyriac Churchwas born in the heart of Mesopotamian civilizations, active in Syria and Aram, extending its service to Persia, India, and Phoenicia. TheArmenian Churcharose on Mount Ararat, where Noah’s ark rested, and expanded from Armenia and Cilicia. TheCoptic Churchemerged from the civilization of the Nile Valley—rich in heritage, Pharaonic wisdom, and early writing.
These churches carried the legacy of their civilizations, never separating from their histories. Rather, they transformed them into bridges for Christian expression across cultures. Oriental Orthodox Christianity remains a part of the national identity of its peoples, sharing in their celebrations, pain, and victories.
The Path to the Gathering
In 1965, the heads of the Oriental Orthodox Churches officially met for the first time at the invitation of Emperor Haile Selassie in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Participating were:Pope Cyril VI(Coptic Church)Mor Ignatius Jacob III(Syriac Church)Catholicos Vazgen I(Armenian Orthodox Church of Etchmiadzin)Catholicos Khoren I(Armenian Orthodox Church of Cilicia)
The Syriac Church in India participated as part of the mother Syriac Church. TheEritrean Orthodox Churchhad not yet been established. A permanent committee was formed to continue coordination, but political circumstances in Ethiopia later halted this process.
In 1995,Catholicos Aram Iwas elected and recognized the importance of reviving these meetings. He reached out to the latePope Shenouda IIIandMor IgnatiusZakka I Iwasof the Syriac Church. With shared spiritual counsel, the first modern gathering of Oriental Orthodox leaders in the Middle East was held in 1996.
They agreed to form a permanent committee, with each Church represented by two members, meeting regularly, followed by the full presidential meeting. Fourteen such gatherings have been held, with this15th meeting taking place in May 2025, affirming continuity and determination to strengthen the faith and unity—in one love and one spirit.
The 2025 Gathering and the Responsibility of Unity
In this 17th centennial year of the Council of Nicaea, the 15th meeting is held in Egypt under the slogan:“One Love in One Spirit in 22.”The heads will discuss theological, educational, pastoral, and ecumenical matters. Working papers will address contemporary challenges. Beyond intellectual exchange, joint prayers will be held in theSaint Mark’s Cathedral in Abbassia, Cairo. Here, the fathers gather aroundPope Tawadros, the Pope of Love, to proclaim the Nicene Creed with the same words and spirit penned in 325 AD—as if written moments ago.
The Significance of Hosting in Egypt
Though the Holy Council of Nicaea met in 325 AD in Asia Minor, the roots of its decisions and teachings came from Egypt, where the hero of the council,Deacon Athanasius, stood against Arianism, declaring the sound doctrine of the Incarnation. The Coptic Church carried the gospel truth to Nicaea, playing a vital role in forming the Creed still recited by churches today.
Choosing Egypt to host this spiritual gathering affirms its ecclesiastical and historical place. It gave birth to monasticism, launched the first theological school, and preserved Orthodoxy through the most difficult eras. In its deserts livedAnthony, Pachomius, Macarius, andAmmonius. Its walls still breathe prayer, and its icons bear witness to the unwavering Orthodox faith.
Witness to Mission and Faith
As we prepare for the 15th meeting, we stand before a living message from our churches. Despite changing times, they have not strayed from the faith defined in Nicaea and lived across centuries. Now publicly renewed,Pope Tawadrosfrom Egypt affirms that Oriental Orthodoxy remains a bearer of salvation, a guardian of truth, and a living witness to unity in faith—even if geographically apart, united in one Head:Jesus Christ.
One in Faith and Hope
FromWadi El-Natrun, where sand is mixed with prayer, hands are lifted in faith, and it is proclaimed to the Church and the world:The covenant continues. The faith endures. Unity is possible.Seventeen centuries have passed since Nicaea, and our Churches still recite the same Creed, live the same testimony. Until the Lord comes again, these meetings serve as torches lighting the way for generations, reminding us that the Orthodox Church walks not alone—but with the fathers, saints, martyrs, and intercessors at every moment.
Soon, from the wilderness of Scetis, the crying voice will rise once more to remind us that thetrue faith is still alive in the hearts of its children—where Orthodoxy is not just a doctrine, but a way of life walked with steadfastness toward the Kingdom.
